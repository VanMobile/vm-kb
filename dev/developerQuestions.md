#### What technology stack will developers be expected to know?

One of our goals is to keep consistency of the technologies used across contracts.

Benefits include...
- helps reduce cognitive overload
- makes it easier to train new developers
- makes it much more seamless for a developer to move from one contract to another

A partial list of our recommended tech stack currently is....
- React.js
- React Native
- Ramda.js (a functional utility library)
- Node.js
- Docker
- RethinkDB, or MongoDB or MySQL

You can see that it's very JavaScript centric.





#### What happens if I can't complete the contract?
Contracts are not tied to the contractor themselves, so we will be able to replace the current developer with another developer to continue to complete the project.

This is the nice thing about keeping our tech stack as consistent as possible across contracts.



#### Do I need a particular type of devbox, like iOS or Windows?

We support both; And the client is abstracted away from caring about these details.

The constraint with Windows is not having the ability to hot-reload test an iOS mobile app on their local Windows box.

However, this is not a blocker because we have options for getting this done. This is one of the great things about working with React Native.
