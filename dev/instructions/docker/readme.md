### docker prereq:  
your OS should be able to handle virtualization


### docker install:  
note that this will also install Oracle VM VirtualBox


### docker usage:  
start -> open VirtualBox  
- make sure the 'default' VM is running
right click on 'default' in the left pane -> start -> start normal
- then after about 30 seconds of loading up, just minimize the VM terminal, since it won't be used

start -> open the 'docker quickstart terminal' app  

```bash
# a test to make sure docker is running through the VM
docker search node
```
