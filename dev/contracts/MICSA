8. 
Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT WILL VanMobile BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST DATA AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Contractor recognizes that the employees and independent contractors of VanMobile, and such employeesâ€™ and independent contractorsâ€™ loyalty and service to VanMobile, constitute a valuable asset of VanMobile.

In respect of this, Contractor agrees not to directly or indirectly hire, solicit, or encourage any other Person to hire or solicit any individual who has been employed or contracted by VanMobile within 24 months before the hiring date or solicitation, or encourage any such individual to leave VanMobileâ€™s employment. This Section 9 does not prevent Contractor from hiring or soliciting any employee or former employee or independent contractor of VanMobile who responds to a general solicitation that is a public solicitation of prospective employees or independent contractors and is not directed specifically to the employees or independent contractors of VanMobile. 
Contractor further acknowledges access to Confidential Information and a position of trust and confidence with VanMobile. In respect of this, Contractor agrees not to directly or indirectly solicit, entice, or attempt to solicit or entice any clients, customers, or suppliers of VanMobile to divert their business or services from VanMobile for a period of 24 consecutive months, beginning on the last day of the last date on which the parties are associated in connection with this Agreement.

11.6 Severability.
