## Dev learning tips and resources

There are three core skill you want to develop...
- JavaScript
- Ramda (which promotes a functional programming approach to programming in JavaScript)


And two frameworks...
- React.js
- React Native


## Ramda

Read the Ramda docs
http://ramdajs.com/docs

- There are about 210 functions, but many are very simple, are some others you'll rarely use.
- Each function as a sample code block, so copy and paste that sample code into the Ramda Repl at
- http://ramdajs.com/repl
- and play around with it until you understand what it's doing
- all the functions perform a simple and single purpose
- work your way through all the code samples
