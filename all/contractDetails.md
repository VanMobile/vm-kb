## Payment structure


### Client to VanMobile payments

semi-monthly invoicing

payment due within 5 days of invoice date
- sometimes this could be negotiated with the Client up to 10 days depending on the Client's specific payroll constraints
- but we try for 5.



### Vanmobile to Outreach and Developer payments
- within 24 hours of receiving payment from the Client
- the deposit will land in your bank account within 2 or 3 business days;
- which is typical for US and Canada but may take a little longer to other countries.
