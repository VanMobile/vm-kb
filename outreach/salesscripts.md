Does your company have an existing mobile application?

## Justification

The outlay is equal to about the cost of one developer.
- however with our program, you get the full time developer, plus the services of a full development team behind it, free of charge.


## Finalization

If you're interested in researching the benefits further, I could have one of our developers actually communicate with you by email.
- He or she would even be able to give you a good ballpark investment and timeframe estimate; 
- and answer any questions that you may have as they come up.
- Shall I give him/her your email address?
   
You can think of it as having a development team on call.

The technologies change fast
- so we can keep you abreast of the best options available
