## Introduction questions

Does your company have an existing mobile application?

How do you think a mobile application would benefit your company?

Have you researched in what ways it could increase sales or revenues for your company?

Have you done a cost/benefit analysis?


Would you like to see what a mobile application would like for your company in three months?





## Justification

The outlay is equal to about the cost of one developer.
- however with our program, you get the full time developer, plus the services of a full development team behind it, free of charge.


## Finalization

If you're interested in researching the benefits further, I could have one of our developers actually contact you by email.
- He or she would even be able to give you good ballpark estimate and timeframe; 
- and answer any questions you may have as they come up.
- Shall I give him/her your email address?
