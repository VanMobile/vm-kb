#### Why should I work here as an Outreach Specialist?

Because this is career that is...
- truly independent,
- remote,
- choose your own hours,
- yet receive full support from a team of outreachers and developers opportunity



#### Are there stock options?
Yes, after six months vesting will commence



#### If I quit, do I still get paid for existing deals?
Every client needs an account representative; you need to be available to field questions and concerns from clients.



#### Are there any quotas or minimaal production requirements or minimal hours?
No there are not. You choose your own hours and make it work within your lifestyle

The only responsiblity is for existing clients that you are receiving current income from active contracts,
- that you maintain that relationship with high quality service
- but only in relation to nontechnical issues.
- so in many cases clients will be very low maintenance



#### What happens in a case where the client and developer wish to make a deal amongst themselve and cut out the middle man.
They are free to do that.
Our goal is to design our service where the advantage is to stay with us; but they may be in a circumstance where it works out better for them that way.
I expect this to be a pretty rare occurrence.
- especially as we get better, faster, and offer more valuable services.



#### What are the challenges or biggest risks with this business model?
The business risk is that there is no demand for software development or mobile applications.
This could be due to there being way more supply of developers than businesses who need software created.
This appears to not be the case in the industry for the foreseeable future.

The technical risk is that the software features are taking longer to get built than what was originally promised.
This is a risk we monitor very closely because it is very difficult to make software estimations.
We try to estimate very conservatively and also try to reduce the client's expectations as much as possible. 
We certainly don't make bold promises on delivery unless we feel very certain.
There are also risks of developers becoming unavailable in the middle of a contract, which could cause delays in ramping up a replacement developer in the middle of a project
- but there are mostly exceptional incidents.  




#### Who is the ideal customer?
I would say a company with an employee count of between 10 and 100.
- and a company where software is not their main production
- since these companies tend to prefer to hire in-house
- but this is not always the case



#### How much is the commission, and does it vary per deal by way of negotiation
The Outreacher's commission is fixed at 5% of the contract amount.
- it is nonnegociable unless in some extraordinary case where it's a super large volume deal.
- but the percentage will never change without the Outreacher's concent.


#### Do I have to be involved with the process of drawing up of the contracts?
It is not necessary since the contracts involve techncial estimations of work and completion estimations,
- which is usually software engineer expertise outside the expectations of the Outreacher.
- but you are certainly welcome to particpate as much as you wish.
- You will certainly have access to contracts themselve but keep in mind that in some cases the client may want you to sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)



#### Do I need technical software know-how or training?
You don't; because you'll be conversing with business people rather than I.T. departments.
- so you'll be having conversations on the business-needs level.
- but you'll get intimate with the usage side of mobile apps, their components, and their uses and value to the business clients.


#### Can I learn to program?
Sure! You'll have access to all the Developer's resources as equally as any developer.
The more you know them better you can understand the industry.



#### What is the competition to this product?

There are some other avenues that clients can consider, but we feel that our offering provides the best of all options for most cases.
Other types of client options include....
- Online or desktop build-it-yourself software. 
- Use existing in house developers, or hire your own developers inhouse.
- Hire remote developers but manage it all in house.
- Outsource overseas
