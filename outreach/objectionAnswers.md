#### How much does it cost?
It cost about the market value of hiring one developer.
- but subtract all the costs and time of procuring and training that developer.


#### How much do we pay up front?
Payments are structure like a regular employee, paying semi-monthly
- so no need to pay upfront in bulk for securing the services


#### How soon can you start on the project?
We could start doing requirements analysis within a few days


#### What are the risks?

A profession risk assessment assessment is done upfront.
- Most of the features you require we have build many times before, so there are no technical challenges there.
- New innovations we give your our best estimates but also keep you in the loop with weekly updates, including re-adjustments to estimates if it becomes necessary
